Compiling and Flashing the MCU

To compile the MCU some library installations are required
Please install the following via your Arduino library manager
before compiling the MCU:

- Adafruit_BNO055
- Adafruit Unified Sensor
- FastPID

Please then go to your Arduino libraries folder and add the Timer-2.1 folder
from the Timer-2.1.zip file. You can find the .zip file here:

ADAS/06_source/ADAS/libraries/Timer-2.1.zip
